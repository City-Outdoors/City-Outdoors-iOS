# City Outdoors: iOS

This package is an iPhone app that fetches data from a [City Outdoors web site](https://github.com/City-Outdoors/City-Outdoors-Web) and allows the user to submit data back.

## Requirements
City Outdoors iOS requires iOS 5 and above.

This project uses [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org) to keep track of 3rd party dependencies and [mogenerator](http://rentzsch.github.com/mogenerator) to generate the Core Data models.

While installing cocoapods isn't required the project contains a build script that assumes that mogenerator is installed.

To install mogenerator using [homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew) :
`brew install mogenerator`
